## service-catalog docs

This directory contains documentation for versions of the service-catalog:

1.  Use-cases
2.  Architecture summary documents

Each version will get its own subdirectory.  Each version's documentation
should be a complete accounting of supported use-cases, architecture, etc for
that version.
