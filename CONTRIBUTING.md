# Contributing to service-catalog

This document should concisely express the project development status,
methodology, and contribution process.  As the community makes progress, we
should keep this document in sync with reality.

## Development status

We're currently collecting use-cases and requirements for our [v1 milestone](./docs/v1).

## Methodology

Each milestone will have a directory within the [`docs`](./docs) directory of
this project.   We will keep a complete record of all supported use-cases and
major designs for each milestone.

## Contributing to a release

If you would like to propose or change a use-case, open a pull request to the
project, adding or altering a file within the `docs` directory.

We'll update this space as we begin developing code with relevant dev
information.
